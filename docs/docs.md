# How docs works?

We use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to automatically generate documentation. When you push some commits to GitHub the documentation will generated by [TravisCi](https://travis-ci.org/NetBiol/hackathon2017). So you don't have to install anything to work with it.

# How to edit the docs?

The documentation files are in the `docs` folder in the root of the GitHub repo. All of the files are MarkDown syntax.
